Hi, this a website for a fictional pizza restaurant I'm making to learn about Flask.
To run this you'll need Python and the Python module Flask installed.
Simply run the file "website.py" from command line then follow the instructions from there.
Also, keep the files in their respective folders otherwise it might not run properly.
